# WT NodeJS API
API written in nodejs to interact with the Winding Tree platform, it creates an
http server with an encrypted ethereum account to send transactions to the WT
platform hosted over the ethereum network.

## Requirements
- Nodejs 8.9.x LTS

### Getting stared
In order to install and run test we must:
```
git clone git@github.com:windingtree/wt-nodejs-api.git
nvm install
npm install
npm test
```

### Running dev mode
With all the dependencies installed, you can start the dev server

First step is add the accounts to the `configuration.json` file. This accounts
will receive some Ether from ganache accounts.
```javascript
{
  local : {
    ...
    "users": ['0x0...1', '0x0...2']
    ...
  }
}

```
Now, we can start Ganache client and run dev server

```bash
npm run dev-net # Start Ganache client
npm run dev # Start server with ETH_NETWORK=local.
```
When `ETH_NETWORK=local` we run internally a script to deploy WT Index and
transfer fonds to the user account.

#### Using local swagger

To use Swagger pointing to localhost, you must update `docs/swagger.json`

```javascript
{
  "schemes": ["http"],
  "host": "localhost:3000"
}

```


## Examples
### Wallet
The very first thing to do, is to add a Wallet. This wallet is used to make
transactions with the Ethereum network. An example of encrypted keystore v3
JSON:
```javaScript
{
    version: 3,
    id: '04e9bcbb-96fa-497b-94d1-14df4cd20af6',
    address: '2c7536e3605d9c16a7a3d7b1898e529396a65c23',
    crypto: {
        ciphertext: 'a1c25da3ecde4e6a24f3697251dd15d6208520efc84ad97397e906e6df24d251',
        cipherparams: { iv: '2885df2b63f7ef247d753c82fa20038a' },
        cipher: 'aes-128-ctr',
        kdf: 'scrypt',
        kdfparams: {
            dklen: 32,
            salt: '4531b3c174cc3ff32a6a7a85d6761b410db674807b2d216d022318ceee50be10',
            n: 262144,
            r: 8,
            p: 1
        },
        mac: 'b8b010fff37f9ae5559a352a185e86f9b9c1d7f7a9f1bd4e82a5dd35468fc7f6'
    }
}
```

This wallet should for now be manually placed into a location specified in `configuration.json`
file under the `privateKeyFile` key.

For the current endpoints documentation, run the API with `npm run dev` and see the `http://localhost:3000/docs`.

With every request that results into a transaction on the Ethereum network (typically data modification),
you have to provide a password for this keyfile in a `X-Wallet-Password` header.
